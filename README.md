Strassenâ€™s Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication ðŸš€
This repository contains an optimized matrix multiplication implementation using Strassenâ€™s Algorithm, a divide-and-conquer approach that improves the standard O(nÂ³) complexity to O(nÂ².81).

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

Recursively splits matrices into submatrices.
Computes intermediate matrices to reduce the number of multiplications.
Merges results to construct the final matrix.
Uses brute force multiplication for small matrices.
ðŸ”¹ Limitations:Works only for even-sized square matrices (update coming soon for general cases!).
ðŸ”¹ Updated code soon >>>


âœ… Efficient for large matrices in numerical computing & graphics! ðŸš€
